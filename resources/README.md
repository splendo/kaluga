## Resources
This Resource Library for Kaluga contains methods for loading various resources from the platform.
Resources are grabbed using a `String` key associated with a resource type.
Making these resources available on the platform is the responsibility of the platform.

## Installing
This library is available on Maven Central. You can import Kaluga Resources as follows:

```kotlin
repositories {
    // ...
    mavenCentral()
}
// ...
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation("com.splendo.kaluga:resources:$kalugaVersion")
}
```

## Usage

### String
You can treat any `String` as a key to a localized `String` value.
By default, this loads the String in the `Localizable.strings` (iOS) or `strings.xml` (Android) files declared in the main project scope.
A `StringLoader` class is provided to overwrite this behaviour.

### Color
The `Color` class is associated with `UIColor` (iOS) and `@ColorRes Int` (Android).
You can treat any `String` as a key to a `Color` value.
By default, this loads the Color in the `Color Assets` (iOS) or `color.xml` (Android) files declared in the main project scope.
A `ColorLoader` class is provided to overwrite this behaviour.

### ThemedColor
`ThemedColorProvider` can be used to obtain a `Color` that has two different values depending on the theme the system is running.
It is aware of Dark and Light themes, and it's bound to it automatically.
To define such a color, the following syntax can be used:
```
val background by themeColor(light="#FFFFFF", dark="#000000")
```
Platforms will be able to use this Color in their code, knowing that it comes automatically in the correct contrast depending on the theme. 
If it's still needed to refer to the single Light and Dark colors, it can be done in the following way:
```
val backgroundColorProvider = themeColor(light="#FFFFFF", dark="#000000")
val background by backgroundColorProvider
val darkBackground = backgroundColorProvider.darkColor
val lightBackground = backgroundColorProvider.lightColor

```

### Image
The `Image` class is associated with `UIImage` (iOS) and `Drawable` (Android).
You can treat any `String` as a key to a `Image` value.
By default, this loads the Image with the corresponding name declared in the main project scope.
An `ImageLoader` class is provided to overwrite this behaviour.

### Font
The `Font` class is associated with `UIFont` (iOS) and `Typeface` (Android).
You can treat any `String` as a key to a `Font` value.
By default, this loads the Font with the same name on iOS and the font resource declared in `font.xml` on Android, as declared in the main project scope.
A `FontLoader` class is provided to overwrite this behaviour.

Unlike the other resources, Font loading may be suspended.
